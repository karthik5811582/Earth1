ALL ABOUT ESSAY ON EARTH
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The rocks make up the earth that has been around for billions of years. Similarly, water also makes up the earth. In fact, water covers 70% of the surface. It includes the oceans that you see, the rivers, the sea and more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thus, the remaining 30% is covered with land. The earth moves around the sun in an orbit and takes around 364 days plus 6 hours to complete one round around it. Thus, we refer to it as a year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just like revolution, the earth also rotates on its axis within 24 hours that we refer to as a solar day. When rotation is happening, some of the places on the planet face the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.toppr.com/ask/question/what-is-a-sun/">sun</a>&nbsp;while the others hide from it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a result, we get day and night. There are three layers on the earth which we know as the core, mantle and crust. The core is the centre of the earth that is usually very hot. Further, we have the crust that is the outer layer. Finally, between the core and crust, we have the mantle i.e. the middle part.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The layer that we live on is the outer one with the rocks. Earth is home to not just humans but millions of other plants and species. The water and air on the earth make it possible for life to sustain. As the earth is the only livable planet, we must protect it at all costs.</p>

<h3><strong>There is No Planet B</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The human impact on the planet earth is very dangerous. Through this essay on earth, we wish to make people aware of protecting the earth. There is no balance with nature as human activities are hampering the earth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Needless to say, we are responsible for the climate crisis that is happening right now. Climate change is getting worse and we need to start getting serious about it. It has a direct impact on our food, air, education, water, and more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The rising temperature and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.toppr.com/guides/essays/natural-disasters-essay/">natural disasters</a>&nbsp;are clear warning signs. Therefore, we need to come together to save the earth and leave a better planet for our future generations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Being ignorant is not an option anymore. We must spread awareness about the crisis and take preventive measures to protect the earth. We must all plant more trees and avoid using non-biodegradable products.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Further, it is vital to choose sustainable options and use reusable alternatives. We must save the earth to save our future. There is no Planet B and we must start acting like it accordingly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Earth is the planet where we live. It is the third planet among the eight planets of Sun and fifth largest among them. It is the only planet where human and other species can live. Essential substances like air, water and land supports life on earth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Earth is made of rocks and came into existence billions of year ago. However, 70% of the surface of the earth is covered by water which we see as the ocean, sea, and rivers and remaining 30% is covered hours to complete a round around the Sun. Which we count as a year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Along with the movement, Earth also rotates on its axis from east to west and complete a rotation in 24 hours which we call a solar day. In that rotation, some of the places on earth face sun and other places get hide from the sun alternatively, which we experienced as day and night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Earth is made up of three layers that is core, mantle and crust. The center is called Core which generally very hot. The outer layer is call crust and in between core and crust, the middle part is known as mantle. We live on outer layer which is made of rocks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Along with human earth is home to millions of species and plants. The presence of water on the surface of the earth and air in the atmosphere makes life possible here. As only livable planet of the sun we should respect and protect our earth from our wrong practices.</p>
